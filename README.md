### simple-component

A simple dependency injector. 

* Batteries included: comes with its own `@Inject` annotation so you don't have to choose between `javax.inject` and `jakarta.inject`.
* Allows static "factory" methods as injection sites.
* No typecasts in generated code.
* Field injection is not supported.
